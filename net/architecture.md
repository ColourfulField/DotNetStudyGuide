.multi-layered architecture, DI, how it helps with unit testing. Talk about mappers and why we need several models \(domain models, DTO models, VM models\).

TASK: Create an example project with that architecture. An example project should be provided so that intern is not stuck on this for too long. As a result of this task an intern should be able to send Â request to the controller and receive response with DB data. The request should start in controller, enter BL layer, create a request abstracted by unitOfWork, get response from DB, and return it all the way back.
