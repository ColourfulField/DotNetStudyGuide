TASK: Create an example project with that architecture. An example project should be provided so that intern is not stuck on this for too long. As a result of this task an intern should be able to send  request to the controller and receive response with DB data. The request should start in controller, enter BL layer, create a request abstracted by unitOfWork, get response from DB, and return it all the way back.
